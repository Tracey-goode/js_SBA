Clarifications:

1. OVERCOMPLICATING problems! Keep it simple
2. make sure touse the function, all code must exist inside the get learner data function. between opening result array and ending result
3. Dates, dont make it hard, no need to make dates dynamic. cycling through dates.
4. make sure theres is a readme
5. break down the problem, 4 steps with smaller steps inside. take into consideration output data compared to input data.
